# Amate Vision Statement

Amate will allow people to order books easily and quickly. People looking for specific titles can quickly add items to their shopping cart, while people browsing for books will have options to filter their searches. An optional account system can provide a faster checkout, but checkout will be done fast and simple, regardless of whether a person has an account or not.

Books can be available as paperback, hardcover, and/or e-book. Books can also be available as new or used. Not all books will be available in all types and conditions and Amate will indicate the types and condition a book is available in, if and when they are in stock.

Amate will have the option to look through a subset of titles (by author, by genre, etc.). Results will show the title of the book, the author, its price, release date and availability. Results that are available will have the option to be added directly to a shopping cart, for customers that know exactly what they are looking for. A customer that is browsing through results can pick a title for more details on the book, as well as recommendations for different titles (based on the same genre, author, etc.).

People who created accounts can set up payment options for faster checkout and see a history of past orders. Account holders can also keep track of books that they may want to buy at a later date. Anyone who has placed an order will be able to check its status, as well as be able to track their order.

Checkout for orders will be user-friendly for anyone placing an order. Customers can review their order and make changes to them easily before putting any personal and payment information. After placing an order, customers will be able to check its status, as well as track their order. Customers are also able to cancel the order within a given time frame after placing it, should they change their mind.

As a mobile application, Amate provides people the ability to order books when they want, from anywhere they can use their phone. To be able to check a title's availability and order at any given time, Amate will prove useful for those who do not mind the wait or want to go out of their way to check the local bookstore for what they want.

Amate is considered a success based on feedback from users and customers of the application. Customers who have ordered from Amate wil have the option to provide written feedback and a rating from one to five after recieving their product. This option will also be available after a customer has been helped with any concerns regarding the app. Therefore, if at least five percent of customers and users provide any feedback, in addition to a rating of three or higher within the first year of release, Amate is considered a success.
