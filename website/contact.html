		  <p>For the first two iterations, our group experince would be described as everything going wrong after the iteration due dates and everything going right after the due dates. All of us had little to no experience with Android studio and git and a lot of the time spent was trying to learn how to do something with the software. It also didn't help that we were all scrambling on the day the iteration was due to get everything together, attempting to merge everything and not having enough time to check everything is working before the last hour it was due. However, it was only after each of the iterations that we understood what was wrong and we were able to fix those problems quite easily (unfortunately, that wouldn't affect the marks we would get for the iteration).</p>
			
		  <p>For the most part, our initial planning for each iteration went well - everyone knew their part for the iteration. It was communication towards the end of the iteration that was one of our weaker points (which led to the above problem).</p>
			
			<p>Our project didn't change too much from the original vision. We were able to keep in line with trying to make a book store app where users could purchase books in an easy and quick manner. Our app looks very plain because of it and a few members of the group were hoping to add covers of the books or make the app look nicer. We all agreed it wasn't something we would get more marks for, so it was something very low priority that we didn't end up doing because of time constraints and, arguably, resources.</p>
			
			<p>As mentioned above, our communication with each other on the project could have been better. We would have been able to find out the problems we faced sooner so we could try to fix it as soon as possible. When thinking about having to work with larger groups in the future, we've come to understand how important communication is.</p>

            <p>What each of us decided to do was to try to improve our procrastinating habits. Putting aside the work until last minute cost us more than we would have liked. Doing test-driven development would be something we would all continue doing. In particular, it allowed us to easily identify classes that broke the single-responsibility principle.</p>

            <p>In the retrospective, we discussed how we were going to handle account-related features without having to modify every activity class to send information of an account as part of the intent. When we came together and discussed it, we came up with a very simple solution that prevented us from having to go through and modify every activity we had, as well as avoiding copy-paste data to the new activities that would have been made.</p>
